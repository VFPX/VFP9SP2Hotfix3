# Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver

**The Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver is not compatible with databases that use features that were added after Visual FoxPro 6.0. If possible, the Visual FoxPro OLE DB Provider should be used instead.**

## Documentation
As of this writing, documentation for the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver is still available online at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/microsoft/visual-foxpro-odbc-driver?view=sql-server-ver15.

**Please note that the VFPODBC driver is no longer supported.**

We strongly recommend using the Visual FoxPro OLE DB provider as a replacement. Please refer to the following article for more information and related links to issues when using the VFPODBC driver: https://web.archive.org/web/20120212190511/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/277772.

This Web release of the Microsoft Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver is intended for customers who have installed Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6 or higher. The Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver is included in MDAC 2.5, which is installed under System File Protection on the Microsoft Windows Millennium and Microsoft Windows 2000 operating systems. Customers running Windows Millennium and Windows 2000 should not install this driver. Additionally, if you have upgraded to MDAC 2.6 from MDAC 2.5, you do not need to install the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver. You can find out whether you already have the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver installed by checking to see if a file called VFPODBC.DLL exists in your Windows System directory.

You can choose between two download options:

- **VFPODBC.MSI**

    This is the recommended setup. It is a fully functional Microsoft Windows Installer setup that will install the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver on your machine.
    
- **VFPODBC.MSM**

    This is a merge-module version of the Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver. It is intended only for developers wishing to distribute the driver with their custom setups. The Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver Merge Module can be used only in setups created by Windows Installer deployment tools.

This release is installed using Microsoft Windows Installer, which is part of Microsoft Office 2000, Microsoft SQL Server 2000, and other Microsoft applications. The Installer is released with many newer Microsoft products, but it may not be on your computer if you are running older versions of Microsoft Office or the Microsoft Windows operating system.
