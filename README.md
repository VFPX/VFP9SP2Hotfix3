# VFP 9 Service Pack 2 (SP2) and Hotfix 3

This repository contains updates to Visual FoxPro Version 9 (VFP9). Use the `VERSION()` command to assess your current version of VFP.

The **latest fully patched version of VFP9** is

```
Visual FoxPro 09.00.0000.7423 for Windows
```

If your version is `09.00.0000.2412` then you don't have any service packs installed.

To upgrade VFP9 to the latest service pack and hotfix, follow these steps.

## Step 1: Upgrade VFP9 to Service Pack 2

If your version is `09.00.0000.5815` then you already have Service Pack 2 installed.  You can skip to the next step to install the latest hotfix.

Execute the file `VFP9_sp2.exe` to update the original release of VFP9 to Service Pack 2.

The file `VFP9SP2_BugFixList.htm` lists the changes in SP2.

##  Step 2: Upgrade VFP9 SP2 to Hotfix 3 (the Latest Hotfix)

Execute `VFP90SP2-KB968409-ENU.exe` to extract files into a folder you will subsequently specify. Follow the instructions in the readme (in that folder) to copy the files to their correct locations.
